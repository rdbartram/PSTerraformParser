Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + null_resource.test0
      id:               <computed>
      triggers.%:       "1"
      triggers.trigger: "test0"

  + module.test1.null_resource.test1
      id:               <computed>
      triggers.%:       "1"
      triggers.trigger: "test1"

  + module.test1.module.test2.null_resource.test2
      id:               <computed>
      triggers.%:       "1"
      triggers.trigger: "test2"


Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
